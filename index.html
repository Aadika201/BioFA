    <h3>What is Ecology?</h3>

    <p>
        Organisms are often affected by the environment in which they live, adapting to survive its conditions. Likewise, their environments are also affected by them, like by reducing the population of a certain species by preying on it. This interaction between living organisms and their environment is ecology.
        <br><br>
        The area in which an organism lives is called its habitat. All the species of animals and plants living in one habitat form the community of it.
    </p>

    <h3>Ecosystem and Roles</h3>

    <p>
        An ecosystem is a unit containing all the organisms in a community and their environment.
        In each ecosystem organisms have some role.

    <h3>Energy Flow</h3>
    <p>
        All living organisms need energy to carry out their metabolic processes. All the energy in an ecosystem comes from the Sun, as plants capture some of its energy in photosynthesis and use it to make carbohydrates, fats and protein. These plants are eaten by animals to get energy themselves, and those animals are often eaten by other animals to obtain a larger amount of energy. This sequence where energy passes from a plant to an animal to another animal is called a food chain. Multiple food chains link to form a food web.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Producers and Consumers</h3>
    <p>
        A food chain begins because plants produce nutrients containing energy that other organisms in the ecosystem need, therefore they are called producers. Animals are called consumers because they cannot create nutrients and eat producers. A primary consumer is one that eats a plant. An animal that eats a primary consumer is a secondary consumer and an animal which eats them is a tertiary consumer. Consumers that feed on decaying matter of organisms are called decomposers.

    <h3>Energy Loss</h3>
    <p>
        When energy passes through a food chain from one organism to the next, 100% of the energy is never passed to it. Some of it is lost to the environment. The whole animal or plant usually isn’t eaten by the consumer. Some parts that are eaten aren’t processed by the body, and sometimes energy released from the breakdown is lost as heat.
